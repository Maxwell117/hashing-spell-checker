I. Everything works.

II.Linear and quadratic was a little complex but made sense eventually after converting each line into paper and tracing steps. Double was difficult because at first I just did R-X MOD R in 2ndhash but that was wrong.The pdf said to do that but, I had to also mod array.size(). Spell check was really difficult. I mean it was basic logic to run on terminal. But it was super hard to make good enough for gradescope. Gradescope is too strict. 

III. Im on Mac but I run it like this. 1)have your files(create_and_test_hash.cc,double_hashing.h,linear_probing.h,quadratic_probing,spell_check.cc)in a folder lets call it "file"
                                       2)open terminal
				       3)enter cd desktop
				       4)enter cd file
			               5)enter  make clean
                                       6)enter make spell_check or ./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt double or ./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt linear or ./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt quadratic
                                       7)enter ./spell_check document1_short.txt wordsEn.txt linear or ./spell_check document1_short.txt wordsEn.txt quadratic or ./spell_check document1_short.txt wordsEn.txt double


IIII. I used my own main for question for each question and I got input via provided files and r value via command line in terminal.

 I dont think I need to reference swap,erase and insert, I knew about those commands for years.
